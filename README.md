# Deep Learning Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! 🎓  
This repository contains my progress, experiments, notebooks and reflections as I learn deep learning and related topics.

---

## 🧠 What this repository is about

- I’m following a self-study journey into **deep learning**: concepts, frameworks, applications.
- I will store here resources, notebooks, code snippets, and mini-projects that I complete along the way.
- I’ll update it whenever I learn something new (and add more resources if I study from other places).

## 📚 Resources and Study Materials

Here are some of the resources I’m currently using:

- YouTube series: [“Deep Learning With Tensorflow 2.0, Keras and Python”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDAPkZ53zKk&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7CxAacxVndI4bE_o3BDtO&index=25)
- Playlist: [“Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning”](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhx4zaYkEjI9kTHTV34iQqRcFoO8RvuxV&si=cbN5SGYuthJ0AOG5)
- …and other random resources and I’ll add as I go.

## 📂 Repository Structure

/DL_basics → Introductory notebooks, fundamentals of deep learning
/DL_minicamp → Short “boot-camp” style projects or intensive workshops
/edu_tech → Educational/technical resources, summaries, reflections
.gitignore → Standard ignore-list

(Structure may evolve as I add more content.)

## ✅ My Goals

- Learn deep learning theory: neural networks, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, etc.
- Gain hands-on coding experience: build and experiment with models in Python / Jupyter notebooks.
- Reflect on learning: create summaries, write mini-projects, and track progress.
- Eventually use deep learning in real-world (e.g., my interest in data science and data engineering).
- Keep the repo updated and usable — future me (and maybe others) can browse it.

---

## 🔧 How to use / contribute

- Browse the folders above and open the Jupyter notebooks (mostly `.ipynb` files).
- If you want to follow along, you can clone this repo and run the notebooks on your local machine or in the cloud (e.g., Google Colab).
- I welcome suggestions! If you see a resource I should add, or improvements to code, you can open an issue or a pull request.

**Happy learning!**
